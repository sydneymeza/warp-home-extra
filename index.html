            For this project, we worked with Warp to design a home page based on
            their project brief. This was an amazing opportunity to learn about
            designing with a team and complete the iterative design process
            (sketches, low fidelity wireframe, and high fidelity prototypes). We
            also received feedback on our wireframe from both students in our class
            and David, a Senior Product Designer at Warp, in order to improve our
            design.

              is a customizable terminal with collaborative tools and AI integration.
              To summarize the project brief, Warp does not have a centralized home
              page for users to view information about their files, team, usage,
              account and learn more about Warp. Currently, a lot of this information
              is in the settings page, which makes it difficult to find. The home page
              that we designed will serve as an aggregator that ultimately allows for
              increased discovery and usage of Warp’s features.

            We first created sketches to explore different layouts for the screen
            and modules (components on the screen). Each person drew a minimum of
            eight different screens. Our project was slightly different from the
            other groups because the home was an aggregator, rather than a feature
            with a distinct flow. Therefore, following conversations with our
            professor, Vanessa, we agree that it was also important for the sketches
            to depict how the layouts would look based on the user state (new user
            versus active user), instead of focusing on having 8 sets of flows.
