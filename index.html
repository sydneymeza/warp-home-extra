            For this project, we worked with Warp to design a home page based on
            their project brief. This was an amazing opportunity to learn about
            designing with a team and complete the iterative design process
            (sketches, low fidelity wireframe, and high fidelity prototypes). We
            also received feedback on our wireframe from both students in our class
            and David, a Senior Product Designer at Warp, in order to improve our
            design.

            <h3>Project Brief</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target=”_blank”>Warp</a>
              is a customizable terminal with collaborative tools and AI integration.
              To summarize the project brief, Warp does not have a centralized home
              page for users to view information about their files, team, usage,
              account and learn more about Warp. Currently, a lot of this information
              is in the settings page, which makes it difficult to find. The home page
              that we designed will serve as an aggregator that ultimately allows for
              increased discovery and usage of Warp’s features.

          <p>
            We first created sketches to explore different layouts for the screen
            and modules (components on the screen). Each person drew a minimum of
            eight different screens. Our project was slightly different from the
            other groups because the home was an aggregator, rather than a feature
            with a distinct flow. Therefore, following conversations with our
            professor, Vanessa, we agree that it was also important for the sketches
            to depict how the layouts would look based on the user state (new user
            versus active user), instead of focusing on having 8 sets of flows.

        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>
          One major design decision we made was regarding the content to display
          on the home page. While we had a list of considerations from the project
          brief, it wasn't feasible to include everything. Drawing inspiration
          from Figma Home, Google Drive and GitHub home, we opted to merge the
          current drive on Warp into our new home pages. This approach enhances
          how intuitive the app is to use and reduces time spent searching for
          desired content. Additionally, we deliberated on how to present metrics,
          live sessions, activity, and Warp content. Centralizing this information
          on a left hand sidebar, we aimed for visual appeal by using profile
          icons for team members, filled bars for metrics, and link icons to
          indicate that clicking on the Warp resources would redirect users.
          Furthermore, we considered what user states to design for. It was
          crucial to cater to both new users (requiring more instructional
          guidance) and active users (with their current content readily
          accessible).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="h3-section">
        <h3>Inspiration From Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          We noticed that many of us organized content using sidebars and a
          topbar. Therefore, we opted to create a left-sidebar (which we noticed
          was an industry standard compared to a right-sidebar) and added a
          welcoming header for a personal touch. We selected the most-commonly
          found modules from our sketches to include in the left sidebar. We also
          wanted the homepage to be customizable after noticing this trend amongst
          the sketches. Thus, we allow users to hide individual modules and the
          left sidebar if desired. Moreover, many of us had separate team and
          individual pages, so we discussed how a user could navigate between
          these, ultimately deciding upon a toggle. Finally, we found that
          visualizing the items (workflows, sessions and notebooks) as boxes,
          rather than in a list, made the interface feel less
          crowded/overwhelming.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="h3-section">
        <h3>Intended Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Our main goal with the home page was to create a user-friendly,
          glanceable interface that allows users to understand their current state
          and easily access their content. We achieved this through a split
          layout: the left sidebar displays metrics, live sessions, activities,
          and resources, while the main section shows folders, files, and
          sessions. Additionally, since Warp is designed for collaboration, it was
          important for users to seamlessly switch between personal and team
          views, which organizes their content while still keeping team
          information accessible. Ultimately, our design aligns with the
          priorities outlined in our project brief and enhances the discovery of
          Warp’s features by moving key functionalities from the settings page to
          the home page.

      <h2>Feedback on Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        We created a five minute presentation of our wireframe using Loom (it is
        addressed to David), which you can watch
        <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/a0beb12a6ac64cef95345878e9811e76" target=”_blank”

        <li class="david">
          If a user is on multiple teams, then a UI may not be the best design
          choice. (David also clarified that while Warp currently only allows a
          user to be on one team, in the future, a user will be able to join
          multiple teams.)

          The wireframe currently does not show how to manage (invite and
          remove) members in the team as well as change permissions, which is
          important for the team page.

        <li class="vanessa">
          You should ensure that the order of modules on the left navigation bar
          is based on what is most important to the user.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          The layout feels similar to Google Drive or Finder, which will make it

          Having too many items in recents may defeat the point of an
          aggregator. In addition, people typically do not interact with a side
          scroll, so it may be unnecessary.

          It would be beneficial to show what happens when you open a folder.

          Rather than displaying all the items, folders and sessions on the

          opens another page.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          People may want to have more control over how they see the items in

      <h2>Second Iteration Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        These are our second iteration lo-fi wireframes, which were revised based on
        the feedback that we recieved:
      </p>
      <div class="lowfiSec">
        <p><b>Personal Homepage: Active User</b></p>
        <img class="lofiFlow" src="assets/lofi-complete-flow.png"/>
      </div>
      <div class="lowfiSec">
        <p><b>Personal Homepage: New User</b></p>
        <img class="lofiFinal" src="assets/lo-fi-new.png"/>
      </div>
      <div class="lowfiSec">
        <p><b>Team Homepage: Member</b></p>
        <img class="lofiFlow" src="assets/lo-fi-team-member.png"/>
      </div>
      <div class="lowfiSec">
        <p><b>Team Homepage: Admin</b></p>
        <img class="lofiFinal" src="assets/lo-fi-team-admin.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        We felt that having four screens was too few to show user interaction
        with the various components, so we created more screens in our second
        iteration. We removed the metrics from the left sidebar since metrics
        was last on our priorities list, and it did not feel necessary for users
        to constantly see this information (better in the account page).
        Moreover, we received a lot of feedback about making the drive more
        customizable and realized that we were missing basic features, like
        trash and a search bar. Therefore, in addition to including these
        features, we added sorting, filters, and two modes for viewing. We also
        decided not to extend the recent items beyond the page because having
        both horizontal and vertical scrolling, especially when the user has
        many items in their drive, could be confusing. Additionally, we changed
        the toggle (navigating between “Personal” and “Team”) to a drop-down
        since David clarified that in the future Warp would allow users to be on
        multiple teams. Finally, we wanted to make it easy to navigate between
        the home page and terminal. We opted to use the same top bar as the Warp
        app, but added a new tab for the home page, replacing the drive tab
        since the drive is integrated into the home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We incorporated most of the feedback in our second iteration, except we
        didn't find it necessary to restrict the drive content on the home
        screen. Our decision was based on the concern that limiting content
        would increase the number of clicks needed for users to access what they
        want. Furthermore, users can organize their items into folders if they
        feel they have too many.

        </div>
        <div id="style-guide-text">
          <p>For our style guide, we based our decisions on the style guide provided in the Warp brand guidelines and added additional 
            items including specific font sizes and an icon library to match the design we created. </p>
          <p>The Warp brand guidelines are based on a minimalist and dark mode design. We believe this startup made the decision to 
            have this overall design idea because the users of their product, developers, often use software that is in dark mode when 
            using a terminal and coding. In addition, developers are often online for long periods of time, so having a website that 
            is minimalistic, professional, and easy to read is important. They use two different fonts, one for the overall website, 
            and one for the terminal which are easily distinguishable so the users know the difference in their usages. While they use 
            a pay-to-use font, they also provide free alternatives for us to use. The main font is non-serif, simple, and easily 
            readable, and the terminal font is very similar to other terminals used on the MacOS and Linux systems which aligns with 
            the user's mental model of a terminal. Warp uses primarily black and white of varying shades, matching with the dark mode 
            aesthetic as well as additional colors used as accents. We think these pops of color create a bit more ‘fun’ on the page, 
            making Warp more than just a basic terminal.</p>
          <p>We used the typography, fonts, and color guidelines in our style guide and added a few more specificities to capture the 
            full range of our design. We checked the Warp brand with the WCAG AA guidelines and found that the dark gray on black could 
            be an issue for accessibility if using a dark gray font on the black. Because we only use white text, we did not change any 
            colors from the Warp brand. We added in a library of icons that was used in our design, which we gathered from Warp’s icon 
            pack. The icons Warp uses are minimalistic, simple, and make it clear what each icon represents to a developer. We 
            downloaded the Warp drive to find the colors for specific icons which were not in the style guide.  In addition, we added 
            font sizes used in our prototype and the radius for rounded corners.</p>

      <h3 class="h3-section">Prototype</h3>
      <p>Our project focuses on depicting the design of the home page based on the user state and the various actions that they 
        can take. Here is an active user navigating through their personal home page to one of their team drives:</p>
      <video loop autoplay muted>
        <source src="assets/highfi.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <p>Here is the prototype of a new user's home screen:</p>
      <img class="highfiImg" src="assets/highfi-new.png"/>
      <p>Here is the prototype for an admin's team drive:</p>
      <img class="highfiImg" src="assets/highfi-admin.png"/>
      <p>We  emphasized key design principles in our final prototype to fulfill our users' needs. First, 
        we wanted to ensure that our design aligns with the mental model users currently have of a 
        homepage/dashboard. To do this, we ensured that the homepage is a central location, meaning users 
        can access everything on the application from the homepage. This includes the ability to go to the 
        terminal, access files, see activity, and view settings, teams, and account information. Secondly, 
        we used hierarchical design and scan patterns to create a layout that is efficient for users. Our 
        scan pattern is based on the F pattern, where users scan horizontally across the top, then vertically 
        down the left side, and finally horizontally across the screen. With this in mind, we have the welcome 
        and navigational information across the top, the sidebar on the left side with key information, and 
        access to files in the center of the screen. This allows users to quickly find what they need on 
        the page. Regarding hierarchy, we ensure that each section has a larger heading and smaller body 
        text so users can easily scan for the main sections and land on what they need to read further.</p>
      <p>Our prototype uses the same structure and design as our final wireframe which is shown and 
        described above. We added in new colors, fonts, and icons as indicated by our style guide to 
        bring our design to life and look like it could be on Warp’s application. </p>

      <h2>Final Feedback from Startup</h2>
      <p>
        We created a five minute Loom demo video of our high fidelity prototype
        (addressed to David), which you can view <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/2d67d99681e74666b512ebe1716f2117?sid=3465c1b8-916b-45fd-9b1d-9db6e62566d3" target=”_blank”>here</a>.

      <p><b>Feedback from meeting with the Warp designers:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the trash can? Not immediately clear → think it is a navigational element to see the deleted files</li>
        <li>Sidebar may get too long if there is lots of activity</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Could have “view more” option to avoid lots of scrolling</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Card layout might be a more readable and customizable design for the home screen</li>
        <li>Consider order of content for new user view</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Do we need to display recents at all if there is nothing there yet?</li>
          <li>Explore Warp should be more front and center</li>
          <li>Order could adapt to user journey</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Ensure that margins and padding (spacing) are consistent throughout prototype</li>
        <li>On team admin page, buttons for members, settings, and billings imply that they bring user to another page</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Potentially change to tab bars, rather than using a popup</li>
          <li>This gives admin opportunity to do more within each section</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Really likes the efficiency of how it is laid out – users can quickly navigate to what they what</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This last feedback was incredibly informative and will be useful for our future iterations of the design. It will also
        be helpful we consider approaches to future design projects.</p>

          <p>With this project, we learned a lot about designing as a team and interacting with real clients in order 
            to achieve a design goal. Overall, communication was a huge part of this process– both communication within 
            our team and with the startup founders. From the very beginning, we prioritized understanding the needs 
            and expectations of our client, and this involved active listening during meetings, thoughtful questions, 
            and thorough documentation of their feedback and concerns.</p>
          <p>One of the key challenges we faced was translating their vision into tangible designs. This required not 
            only creative problem-solving but also a deep understanding of design principles and user experience 
            considerations. We took their feedback and continuously iterated on our designs, constantly striving 
            to align with their expectations while also incorporating our own expertise and insights.</p>
          <p>Throughout the process, collaboration within our team was essential. We leveraged each other's strengths 
            and expertise, dividing tasks effectively to ensure that every aspect of the project received attention to 
            detail. Clear communication and regular check-ins allowed us to stay aligned on our goals and make timely 
            adjustments as needed.</p>
